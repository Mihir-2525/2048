## How to Play

The goal of the game is to reach the 2048 tile by sliding numbered tiles on a grid. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one, with the value of the sum of the two tiles. After each move, a new tile randomly appears on the grid. The game ends when the player reaches the 2048 tile or when there are no more valid moves.
